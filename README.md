# Search-Engine

The `SearchEngine` folder contains code for the implementation of the Search Engine,
`SearchEngineTest` contains unit tests for the Code in `SearchEngine`.

Since the `SearchEngine` Project is a class library, it cannot be executed directly so the 
`ConsoleAppTester` which contains a console app has been created to make it possible to test
the classes in the class library.
